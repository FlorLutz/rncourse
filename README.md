# React Native Course Goals App

## Description

This is my first React Native project. It is a simple interactive list for creating course goal items and reviewing them. As of now, all data is stored in state and none permanent.

## Key Learnings

- first experiences with react native and the Expo framework
- applying styles
- getting to know native components provided by react native like View, Text, TextInput, FlatList, ScrollView and Button
- creating components and using common hooks like useState
- setting up emulators for android and iOS

## Additional info

The colors were inspired by Tailwind's native sky-palette.
Future features should include a permanent storage of data.
